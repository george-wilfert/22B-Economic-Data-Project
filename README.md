This report investigates how well we can predict changes in the housing market using simple economic indicators with the help of Python. We used tools like Pandas to organize data and Seaborn to create charts, looking at data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Our main approach was using basic prediction models to forecast future housing trends. We found that these indicators can tell us about the health of the housing market. Our results show that understanding these signs can help predict changes in the housing market more accurately, which is important for making good economic and political decisions. This study helps us understand how different economic indicators are correlated and how they affect the housing market.
